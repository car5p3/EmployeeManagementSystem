# EmployeeManagementSystem
This Employee Management System, built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, provides role-based access control for employees and administrators. Employees can log in securely using bcrypt.js, mark tasks as done, view their details, salary, and leave balance (max 5 per month), receive announcements, send/receive messages, and manage personal notes. Admins have full CRUD access to employee records, salary updates, task assignments, announcements, and private notes. A public chat feature enables communication between all users. Authentication is managed with JWT, ensuring secure access, and the system is ready for deployment with environment variable support. ðŸš€
